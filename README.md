# 🏊‍♂️ Go Piscine – First-Year Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed during an intensive Go (Golang) programming sprint in my first year of computer science studies.

## 📚 Overview

The goal of this "piscine" was to dive into the Go language through daily challenges and exercises. It helped me build a strong foundation in Go while improving my problem-solving skills and code structure practices.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Core Go syntax and idioms
- Working with types, pointers, slices, structs, and interfaces
- Writing clean, modular, and testable code
- Implementing basic algorithms and utilities in Go
- Using Git for version control and project management

## 💡 Sample Projects

- Reimplementing standard library functions
- Basic algorithm exercises (sorting, searching, recursion)
- Command-line tools and small utilities
- Error handling and file operations

## 🔧 Technologies

- Go (Golang)

## 🧠 Personal Reflection

This experience gave me a solid start with Go and sharpened my ability to work independently, read documentation, and write clean, reliable code. It was also a great opportunity to explore a new language through hands-on practice.
